I am a Consultant in WSP UK's Transport Net Zero team.
I have worked at WSP for three years, in New Zealand and the United Kingdom, between their Wellington, Auckland, Leeds, and London offices.

I started my career as a Graduate Transport Planner in Wellington, New Zealand. 
While at WSP NZ, I had [research publicly published][NZTA Research]{:target="_blank"}, presented at multiple conferences, wrote a [WSP insight][WSP Insight]{:target="_blank"}, and became a Member of Engineering New Zealand.

In my current Transport Net Zero Consultant role, I have become an expert in whole life carbon assessment for transport infrastructure projects.
One highlight has been developing a Python Dash web application to automate the assessment, visualisation, and reporting of road user emissions from transport model output.
Another highlight has been developing the [Midlands Connect Baseline Emissions Dashboard (a.k.a. MiOutcomes)][MC Baseline]{:target="_blank"} - a complex multi-page interactive web application developed in Dash Enterprise.

I have a Bachelor of Engineering (Honours) with First Class Honours, specialising in Engineering Science, from the University of Auckland.
This is a Washington Accord accredited degree.
I sub-specialising in Operations Research (OR).

The aim of my [enginnering honours' research][Honours Research]{:target="_blank"} was to use artificial neural networks to predict the future behaviour of the Lorenz chaotic attractor. I used LaTeX for the typesetting of the research.\
