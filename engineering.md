I am a Consultant in WSP UK's Transport Net Zero team.
I have worked at WSP for three years, in New Zealand and the United Kingdom, between Wellington, Auckland, Leeds, and London offices.

I started my career as a Graduate Transport Planner in Wellington, New Zealand. 
While at WSP NZ, I had research publicly published, presented at multiple conferences, wrote a WSP insight, and became a Member of Engineering New Zealand.

In my current Transport Net Zero Consultant role, I have become an expert in whole life carbon assessment for transport infrastructure projects.
One highlight, as a Transport Net Zero Consultant, has been developing a Dash application in Python to automate the assessment of road user emissions from transport model output.
Another outcome I am proud of is that I played a critical role in developing the [Midlands Connect Baseline Emissions Dashboard (a.k.a. MiOutcomes)][MC Baseline]{:target="_blank"} - a complex multi-page interactive web application developed in Dash Enterprise.

I studied a Bachelor of Engineering (Honours) / Bachelor of Music conjoint at the University of Auckland.
My engineering specialisation was Engineering Science, sub-specialising in Operations Research (OR).
I was awarded my engineering degree with First Class Honours.

The aim of my enginnering honours' research was to use artificial neural networks to predict the future behaviour of the Lorenz chaotic attractor. I used LaTeX for the typesetting of the research.\
