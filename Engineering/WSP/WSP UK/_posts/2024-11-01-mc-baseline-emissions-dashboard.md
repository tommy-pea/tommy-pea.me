The Midlands Connect Baseline Emissions Dashboard is an interactive Python Dash web application.
It was developed in Dash Enterprise.

I led the project team in delivering a proof of concept, then minimal viable product.
I ran daily check-in meetings with the project team to discuss and share progress, re-allocate and re-prioritise tasks, address blockers, ask and answer questions, and discuss how the team was feeling and whether tasks needed to be redistributed between team members.

Following delivery of a minimal viable product, I contributed in a check-and-challenge and guidance role, ensuring that the project team clearly understood the scope and methodology of technical tasks at hand.
I liaised with, and challenged, the Project Manager to ensure their vision was being delivered to within realistic time frames.
