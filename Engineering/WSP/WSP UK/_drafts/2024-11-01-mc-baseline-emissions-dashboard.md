The Midlands Connect Baseline Emissions Dashboard is an interactive Python Dash web application developed in Dash Enterprise.

I led the technical project team in delivering a proof of concept, then minimal viable product.
I ran daily check-in meetings to discuss and share progress, re-allocate and re-prioritise tasks, address blockers, ask and answer questions, and discuss how everyone was feeling and whether tasks needed to be redistributed between team members.
I led this delivery in a constrained time frame.

Following completion of a minimal viable product, I contributed in a check-and-challenge and guidance role, ensuring that the project team clearly understood the scope and methodology of technical tasks at hand.
I liaised with, and challenged, the Project Manager to ensure their vision was being delivered to within realistic time frames.
