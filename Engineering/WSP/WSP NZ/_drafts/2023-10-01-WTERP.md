Greater Wellington Regional Council (GWRC) were preparing a Vehicle Kilometres Travelled (VKT), and emissions, reduction strategy for Wellington. 
Decision makers at the council needed a Wellington-specific evidence base to understand the complexities of the task, and to guide and inform the choices they make.
I delivered these evidence based insights to inform Wellingtonâ€™s VKT reduction strategy by investigating the travel behaviours of Wellingtonians, with a special focus on VKT.
I used Python and Jupyter Notebooks - with libraries including pandas, geopandas, shapely, datetime, matplotlib, and seaborn - to clean, wrangle, combine, analyse, and visualise, the New Zealand (NZ) Ministry of Transport (MOT)'s complex Household Travel Survey (HTS) datasets.

Outcomes of this work included delivery of a reproducible method to wrangle and analyse HTS datasets, a technical report, and a presentation at the NZ Modelling User Gruop (NZMUGS) conference.
