I analysed and wrangled multiple datasets including the household travel survey, crash analysis system, traﬃc monitoring system, Stats NZ population projections, and Ministry of Transport historic Vehicle Kilometres Travelled (VKT).
I prepared, and delivered, two reports:
1. Crash Outcomes with Declining Light Vehicle Kilometres of Travel
2. Initial Investigations on Light Vehicle Kilometres Travelled
The report on light vehicle kilometres traveleed is published as a Te Puna Taiao strategic insight report by Waka Kotahi NZ Transport Agency under the title ["Household travel in our major urban areas”][NZTA]{:target="_blank"}".

I have presented the findings from the project's research at multiple conferences.
Firstly in 2022 at i-CON, WSP's global internal virtual conference, I presented both aspects of the research with a focus on crash outcomes.
In March 2023, I presented at the Transportation Group's conference on my investigations into a reduction in light vehcicle kilometres travelled.

As well as the NZTA strategic insight publication, I wrote and prepared a short summary of the light vehicle kilometres reduction research which is published as an insight piece - [Winding back how far we drive: Aotearoa New Zealand’s bumpy road ahead][WSP Insight]{:target="_blank"}.
