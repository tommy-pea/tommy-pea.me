Feb. 2022 - Dec. 2022

I analysed and wrangled multiple datasets including the household travel survey, crash analysis system, traﬃc monitoring system, Stats NZ population projections, and Ministry of Transport historic vehicle kilometres travelled.
I prepared, and delivered, two reports:
1. Crash Outcomes with Declining Light Vehicle Kilometres of Travel and Initial
2. Investigations on Light Vehicle Kilometres Travelled
The report on light vehicle kilometres traveleed has been published as a Te Puna Taiao strategic insight report by Waka
Kotahi under the title “Household travel in our major urban areas”.
I have presented the findings from this research at multiple conferences.
I wrote and prepared a short summary of the work which is published as an insight piece on WSP NZ's website.
