I derived evidence-based insights to inform Wellingtonâ€™s vehicle kilometres travelled (VKT) reduction strategy. 
Greater Wellington Regional Council (GWRC) were preparing a VKT, and emissions, reduction strategy for Wellington. 
Decision makers at the council needed a Wellington-specific evidence base to understand the complexities of the task, and to guide and inform the choices they make.
I delivered this evidence-base.
I investigated the travel behaviours of Wellingtonians, with a special focus on VKT.
I used Python and Jupyter Notebooks - with libraries pandas, geopandas, shapely, datetime, matplotlib, and seaborn - to
clean, wrangle, combine, analyse, and visualise, the New Zealand (NZ) Ministry of Transport (MOT)'s complex Household Travel Survey (HTS) datasets.
