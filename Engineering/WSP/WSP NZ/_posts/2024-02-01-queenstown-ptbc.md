Dec. 2022 - Feb. 2024

I wrote an advisory paper identifying the potential for on-demand transit services to be included within the proposed
public transport network for Queenstown.
I researched local and international case studies, as well as technical literature, then recommended preferred on-demand transit service characteristics for Queenstown’s current, and future strategic, context.
In preparing recommendations, I considered the demographic and geographic context of the area, identified public transport network gaps, detailed considerations of on-demand transit within a Queenstown context, and assessed the potential for on-demand transit service in diﬀerent local areas.

In addition to the on-demand transit advisory paper, I undertook the economics analysis for the Queenstown
Transport Business Case in line with Waka Kotahi NZ Transport Agency's full economics procedure.
