Read the research here: [Household travel in our major urban areas][NZTA]{:target="_blank"}

New Zealand's Emissions Reduction Plan had a target to reduce total kilometres travelled by the light vehicle fleet by 20 per cent by 2035 through improved urban form and providing better travel options, particularly in our largest cities.
With a focus on major urban areas, I investigated the feasibility of achieving a 20% reduction in light vehicle kilometres travelled.

The publication of the NZ Transport Agency strategic insight "Household travel in our major urban areas" was the outcome of a research project on the impact of a vehicle kilometres travelled reduction.
