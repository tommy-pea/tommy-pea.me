Read the research here: [Household travel in our major urban areas][NZTA]

New Zealand's Emissions Reduction Plan had a target to reduce total kilometres travelled by the light vehicle fleet by 20 per cent by 2035 through improved urban form and providing better travel options, particularly in our largest cities.
With a focus on major urban areas, I investigated the feasibility of achieving a 20% reduction in light vehicle kilometres travelled.
