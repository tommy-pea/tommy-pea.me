The [Queenstown Public Transport Business Case][QTPTBC Home]{:target="_blank"} focuses on the public transport investment decisions over the next 15 years in the Queenstown area.

I was responsible for delivering two pieces of work:
1. The economics analysis.
2. The on-demand transit advisory paper.

In the [Strategic Business Case][QTPTBC]{:target="_blank"}, see pages 76 for the preferred option economic assessment, and page 56 for the short list cost-benefit analysis.
See page 259 of the [QTPTBC Advisory Papers][Advisory Papers]{:target="_blank"} to read the on-demand transit advisory paper.

I undertook the economics analysis for the Queenstown PTBC in line with the full economics procedure detailed in NZ Transport Agency's Monetised Benifits and Costs Manual.

The advisory paper I wrote identifies the potential for on-demand transit services to be included within the proposed public transport network for Queenstown.
I researched local and international case studies, as well as technical literature, then recommended preferred on-demand transit service characteristics for Queenstown’s current, and future strategic, context.
In preparing recommendations, I considered the demographic and geographic context of the area, identified public transport network gaps, detailed considerations of on-demand transit within a Queenstown context, and assessed the potential for on-demand transit service in diﬀerent local areas.
