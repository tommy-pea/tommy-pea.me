I was the secretary for the WSP NZ Technical Director (TD) Market Engagement Working Group.
For this internal responsibility, I recorded meeting minutes and actions, followed up with working group TDs to ensure actions were completed, organised key people to present on relevant topics, and prepared market engagement advice documentation to distribute more to all WSP NZ TDs.
