Jul. 2024 - Nov. 2024

I led the project team in delivering a proof of concept within a highly constrained time horizon. 
I ran daily check-in meetings with the project team to share progress, re-allocate and re-prioritise tasks, remove blockers, ask and answer questions, and discuss how we were feeling and whether resources need to be shifted.

I continued contributing to the project - following a proof of concept delivery - in a check-and-challenge and guidance
role, ensuring that the project team clearly understood the scope and methodology of the technical tasks at hand.
I regularly communicated with and challenged the Project Manager to ensure their vision was being delivered to within realistic time frames.

The dashboard was developed in Dash Enterprise using Python.
