To demonstrate engineering competence, I need to provide my work history (CV) demonstrating my involvement in complex engineering activities.

Complex engineering problems include some, or all, of:
* wide-ranging or conflicting technical, engineering, and other related issues
* no obvious solution, which means an original method of analysis is needed.
* can’t be resolved without in-depth engineering knowledge
* issues not often experienced
* aren’t covered by the standards and codes of practice for professional engineering
* diverse groups of stakeholders with a wide range of needs
* significant consequences in a range of contexts.

Complex engineering activities include some, or all, of:
* diverse resources, e.g. people, money, equipment, materials and technologies
* resolving critical problems that occur when a variety of technical, engineering and other related issues interact
* new materials, techniques or processes, or the innovative use of existing materials, techniques, or processes
* significant consequences in a range of contexts.

Tips:
* If the work samples could be completed by an engineering technician, they will not meet the level of complexity requirements for CPEng.
Have a look at Appendix 2 for our full definition of complexity levels across different types of Chartership.
* Clearly explain the complexity of each of the work samples you provide as evidence in your application.
To do this, think about what challenged you and how you solved those challenges.
