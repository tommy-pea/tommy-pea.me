I am an engineer and a musician.
I have worked at WSP for three years between Wellington, Auckland, Leeds, and London in the transport sector.
Music-wise in the UK, I played with the Leeds Symphony Orchestra, Salomon Orchestra, Weekend Opera Workshops, and did private relief teaching for a friend.

I studied at the University of Auckland.
I have a Bachelor of Engineering (Honours) with First Class Honours specialising in Engineering Science and a Bachelor of Music majoring in Classical Performance.

My engineering courses focused on topics including operations research, statistics, stochastic modelling, data analysis and visualisation, feature engineering, time series analysis, machine learning, linear programming, integer and mixed-integer programming, algorithms for optimisation, mathematical modelling, calculus, and signal processing.

Alongside engineering, I studied violin performance with Stephen Larsen. I took music courses including classical ensemble playing, music culture, musical interface design, pedagogical approaches, music production, and music theory.
