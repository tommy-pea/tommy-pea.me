I am an excellent data analyst, visualiser, communicator, and problem solver. 
I can code, and solve complex problems, in Python, R, MATLAB, and Microsoft Suite software products.

I work as a Transport Net Zero Consultant at WSP UK in London.
I've worked at WSP for three years between Wellington, Auckland, Leeds, and London in the transport sector.

Outside of work, I try to keep my music alive - I play the violin.
In 2024, I have played with the Leeds Symphony Orchestra, Salomon Orchestra, Weekend Opera Workshops, and have done some relief teaching for a friend.

I studied at the University of Auckland.
I have a Bachelor of Engineering (Honours) with First Class Honours specialising in Engineering Science and a Bachelor of Music majoring in Classical Performance.

My engineering courses focused on topics including operations research, statistics, stochastic modelling, data analysis and visualisation, feature engineering, time series analysis, machine learning, linear programming, integer and mixed-integer programming, algorithms for optimisation, mathematical modelling, calculus, and signal processing.

In music I studied violin with Stephen Larsen. Other courses included classical ensemble playing, music culture, musical interface design, pedagogical approaches, music production, and music theory.

This website is a small personal project which I imagine will be constantly changing.
