This is my site, a small personal project which I imagine will be constantly changing.\
The site has a few purposes:
1. Recording and maintaining a Curriculum Vitae (for engineering and for music).
2. Working towards engineering chartership - it's more exciting recording my progress in here than an Excel workbook.
3. Practice using GitHub and GitHub Sites - I've built it using the Minimal Mistakes Jekyll Theme.
4. Book reviews - this is something I've decided I want to do for some reason. Not to criticise; more to record quotes that move me, and keep track of what I've learned incase I want to go back to it.
5. Blog about anything else I feel like blogging about. Mainly for myself to come back to and reflect on.
