The New Zealand Community Trust (NZCT) Chamber Music Contest is an annual classical music competition for school students.
In 2016, I played violin in the Apollo Trio and we won the National Best Performance of a New Zealand work.
We played Garreth Farr's Mondo Rondo for Piano Trio.
As part of our rehearsal and development, we even had a rehearsal session with Gareth Farr himself in the Adams Concert Room at Victoria University of Wellington!
